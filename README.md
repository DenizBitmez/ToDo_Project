# TO-DO App REST API  

## Overview  

This project is a REST API service for a TO-DO application developed using **Golang** and the **Gin** framework. Users can create TO-DO lists, add steps to these lists, and manage them. There are two user roles in the system: **regular user** and **admin**.  

## Features  

* Authentication with JWT  
* Role-based authorization (admin/user)  
* Creating, updating, and soft-deleting TO-DO lists  
* Creating, updating, and deleting steps for each list  
* Soft delete functionality to prevent data loss  
* Admin can access all users' data  

## Technologies Used  

* **Programming Language**: Golang  
* **Framework**: Gin  
* **Authentication**: JWT  
* **Database**: In-memory (Mock repository)  
* **API Testing**: Postman  
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
* **Hosting**: Render (for frontend)  

## User Credentials  

**Regular User**  

    * Username: `user1`  
    * Password: `user123`  

**Admin**  

    * Username: `admin`  
    * Password: `admin123`  

## Installation  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kullaniciadi/todo-api.git

## Architecture  

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles:  

* **Handler (Controller)**: Handles HTTP requests.  
* **Service**: Contains business logic.  
* **Repository**: Manages data access operations.  
* **Model**: Defines data structures.  
* **Middleware**: Handles authorization operations.  
* **pkg/jwt**: Manages token operations.  

## Frontend
